# Christmas Tree of Hanoi
A Christmas themed version of Tower of Hanoi built in Lua running on [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)
Reassamble the Christmas Tree on the third trunk by moving the top branch from a layer to another layer - bigger branches cannot be placed on top of smaller branches!
Controls - the trunks are labelled 1,2,3 from left to right. Hold down the key corresponding to the starting trunk and tap the key corresponding to the end trunk to move a branch.
There is one object - the layer - and everything else is done in main
Everything in Layer.lua and main.lua was written by us, the two libraries (push and class) and the font were written by someone else.
We used Jamie Holloway's Lua tutorial (https://github.com/KEGSCodingClub/lua-pong) as an inspiration.
